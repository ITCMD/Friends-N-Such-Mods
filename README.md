# Friends-N-Such-Mods



A Github Repository where you can get the latest updates for the friends-n-such server



## Windows Instructions

1. Download the `updator.bat` file and put it in the Friends-N-Such `.minecraft` folder. To get to this folder, open MultiMC, select the "Friends N Such" instance, and in the right panel press the `Minecraft Folder` button.
2. On your first run (or if you ever want to quickly re-download everything in case something was changed) run the **`Force Update.bat`** file.
3. Whenever you want to update in the future, you do not have to re-download anything, you can simply run **`updator.bat`** and it will download new mods, mod config, and shaders if there are any available.

## Mac/Linux Instructions

1. Open a terminal window in the Friends-N-Such .minecraft folder. To find this folder, open MultiMC, select the "Friends N Such" instance, and in the right panel press the `Minecraft Folder` button.

2. Run  ` git clone https://github.com/ITCMD/Friends-N-Such-Mods update`

3. Copy the contents of the `update` folder into your .minecraft folder. Overwrites are not necessary unless you are experiencing issues.

4. Delete the `update` folder in the .minecraft foler.


   *This part is a work in progress. If you think you can improve the mac/linux commands using `cp` or `rsync` please suggest a command or commands in the [issues section](https://github.com/ITCMD/Friends-N-Such-Mods/issues). Basically, I'd love a way to quickly add any folders or files from the `update` folder to the .minecraft folder, overwriting existing files and only removing files that aren't in the repo from `mods`.*
